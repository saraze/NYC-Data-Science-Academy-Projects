# Project 2: Interactive Visualization using RStudio's Shiny Web Application

###For this project I built an interactive visualization of static and motion bubble charts for exploring the relationship between population growth, GDP per Capita, and gini coefficient. 

###Folders and Files herein:
***
###Data Downloaded and Cleaned Folder: Includes the original data (CLASS.xlsx, gdpcap.csv, popgrowth.csv, totalpop.csv, and gini.csv) and the file (Data Cleaning for Shiny.R) with all the code used to prepare the data for visualization. 

###Shiny Bubble App Folder: A Shiny app requires two components: (1) user interface script (ui.R) and (2) a server (server.R) script. The user interface script controls the layout and appearance of the app and the server script contains the instructions needed to build the app. The other files in the folder--inspiration.md and sourceclassdef.md--are called in the ui.R script to display their respective text in the app. The RDS files in the subfolder comprise the final data files prepared for use in the app.
