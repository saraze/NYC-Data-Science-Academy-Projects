# Project 1: Web Scraping and Data Analysis in Python

### For this project I scraped the last words of executed offenders from the [Texas Department of Criminal Justice Website](https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html).

###Exec.csv: Final CSV of all executed offenders' last statements and other variables available on the website: County, Date of Execution, Race, etc.

###Innocent.csv: CSV of all the offenders who mentioned the word "innocent."
